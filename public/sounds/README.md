# Sound Files

This directory contains placeholder sound files for the game. In a production environment, you would replace these with actual sound files.

Required sound files:

- footstep.mp3 - Sound of player footsteps
- shoot.mp3 - Sound of weapon firing
- hit.mp3 - Sound when a bullet hits a target
- death.mp3 - Sound when a player or entity dies

Note: The actual sound files are not included in this repository. The game code is set up to handle the absence of these files gracefully.
